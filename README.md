# Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Model

## Introduction
This project implements a machine learning model to predict lung cancer risk based on demographic information and health indicators. It serves as a preliminary screening tool to identify individuals who may benefit from further medical evaluation.

## Problem Statement
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide. Early detection significantly improves survival rates, but screening all individuals is resource-intensive. This model aims to help identify high-risk individuals who would benefit most from advanced screening procedures.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (`Dataset/survey lung cancer.csv`) contains 309 records with 16 features including:

- Demographic information (gender, age)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption)
- Symptoms (coughing, fatigue, chest pain)
- Medical history (chronic disease, allergies)

Each record is labeled as either having lung cancer or not.
